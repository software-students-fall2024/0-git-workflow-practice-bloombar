# Hello world!

This is a new file I made in my local repository... I'm now going to "stage", "commit", and "push" this file to GitHub so other people can see it.

I'm also going to add a link to an article I found interesting related to software development/engineering, and a paragraph or two about what I find interesting about that article.

[The article I found interesting](https://www.wired.com/story/inside-the-quest-to-put-a-robotic-lander-on-the-moon/)

I found this article interesting because it talks about the challenges of landing a robotic lander on the moon. It's interesting to me because it's a real-world example of the kind of challenges that software developers and engineers face when working on complex projects.
